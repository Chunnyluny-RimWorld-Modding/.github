<h2 align= "center">About the organisation</h2>
<p align= "center">🙋‍♀️ This organisation will contain all RimWorld related mods I make and contribute to. Also I want to have a community-organisation where people can join as member to keep up-to-date.</p>

<p align= "center">📧 Contact - see discord and slack buttons at the top.</p>

<p align= "center">🌈 Contribution guidelines - use the issue templates when submitting issues. Don't forget to tag them with matching labels, you can also use the contribution/credit label if you want to be mentioned for your contribution. When you have marked your issue or pull request with the matching labels, these will be put on one of the 3 project boards.</p>

<p align= "center">📚 Project board - The project boards are public so people can see what will be worked on. For example when they submit an issue, you can see when it is planned. This includes the DogApparel Trello board and the DogApparel GitHub board, so you can stay up-to-date to the progress of the mod. This makes it easier for modusers to check when an issue is planned.</p>

<p align= "center">👩‍💻 Useful resources - There are templates for issues and feature request so people can follow this template, which will make the workflow easier to manage. See .github repository for default files and community health files.</p>

<p align= "center">🏡 Discussions - Discussions are hosted via the DogApparel mod because it is my first RimWorld mod and it will be used as template for future mods.
All discussions will be surfaced to the organization Discussions tab. By default, all members of the organization will be able to create and comment on discussions. Members can now share updates or ask questions to the entire organization. This will keep the discussions more on a centered spot.</p>
